# JPaint

The aim of this project was to create a simple painting program using Java. The application features a UI built using swing that allows for basic drawing capabilities. The project also includes a simple multithreaded local server that can fetch and save drawings as xml-files as well as a client class to interact with the server on behalf of the paint application.
